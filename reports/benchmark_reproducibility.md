This report proves local benchmark reproducibility only. It keeps external provider and human-review gaps visible instead of counting them as complete. The git commit and dirty samples are generation-time context; the evidence bundle SHA is the durable anchor for the artifacts listed below.

## Beta Test Boundary

- ready: `true`
- scope: beta/public test release without superiority, fully-reviewed, or world-class claims
- policy: Human blind-review, native permission enforcement, real client telemetry, and ledger acceptance may be deferred for beta/public testing, but public claims must remain blocked until those evidence entries are accepted.
- required wording: Use beta, public test, or technical preview wording; do not claim world-class readiness, fully reviewed quality, or proven superiority over baseline.

| Blocker |
| --- |
| none |

| Deferred evidence | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `provider-holdout` | Provider-backed source evidence exists, but formal ledger submission and reviewer acceptance are still pending before public claims. |
| `human-adjudication` | Human adjudication evidence is still pending; deferred for beta/public testing and still required before superiority, fully-reviewed, or world-class claims. |
| `native-permission-enforcement` | Native enforcement proof is still pending; deferred for beta/public testing and still required before world-class claims. |
| `native-client-telemetry` | Real client telemetry is still pending; deferred for beta/public testing and still required before world-class claims. |

## Public Claim Boundary

- ready: `false`
- scope: public benchmark or world-class readiness claim
- policy: Local reproducibility can pass before public claims; public claims require provider evidence, human adjudication, clean release lock, accepted world-class evidence, and complete source checks.

| Blocker |
| --- |
| human blind-review adjudication is incomplete |
| phase-one provider matrix is incomplete |
| phase-one three-reviewer adjudication is incomplete |
| world-class evidence is not accepted yet (4 open gaps, 4 ledger pending) |
| world-class source checks are not all accepted (6/14 pass, 8 blocked) |

## Release Lock

- ready: `true`
- reason: only generated evidence artifacts were dirty at generation time
- status scope: generation-time status before this report is written

## Evidence Bundle

- algorithm: `sha256(path,label,exists,artifact_sha256)`
- artifacts: `25` / `25`
- sha256: `75c9a7c5f5666327dcfc2c17865e4886575a7afbed4614f6e720e205ae203be6`

## Failure Disclosure

- path: `evals/failure-cases.md`
- disclosed cases: `3`
- policy: Keep representative failures visible and tied to regression checks.

## Limits

- The git commit and dirty flags are generation-time context; release lock is blocked by source changes, while generated evidence artifacts are tracked separately.
- Provider-backed model holdout source evidence is complete, but ledger acceptance still requires a valid independently reviewed submission packet.
- Pending blind-review decisions are visible but do not count as human adjudication.
- World-class readiness remains false until external and human evidence gaps close.
- Beta/public testing may proceed without human blind-review only when wording avoids superiority, fully-reviewed, or world-class claims.
