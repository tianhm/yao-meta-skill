## Early Watchlist

| File | Lines | Kind | Recommended next split |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `scripts/render_benchmark_reproducibility.py` | `719` | `cli-script` | Watch this file before adding new responsibilities; extract a helper module when one concern dominates. |
| `tests/verify_evidence_consistency.py` | `719` | `test` | Break broad integration assertions into focused verifier helpers when the next behavior change lands. |
| `tests/verify_world_class_evidence_intake.py` | `706` | `test` | Break broad integration assertions into focused verifier helpers when the next behavior change lands. |
| `tests/verify_yao_cli.py` | `700` | `test` | Break broad integration assertions into focused verifier helpers when the next behavior change lands. |
| `scripts/render_evidence_consistency.py` | `670` | `cli-script` | Watch this file before adding new responsibilities; extract a helper module when one concern dominates. |
| `scripts/render_world_class_operator_runbook.py` | `651` | `cli-script` | Watch this file before adding new responsibilities; extract a helper module when one concern dominates. |
| `tests/verify_output_review_adjudication.py` | `600` | `test` | Break broad integration assertions into focused verifier helpers when the next behavior change lands. |

## Release Rule

- `block` hotspots should be split before governed release.
- `warn` hotspots can ship only when Review Studio keeps them visible and a reviewer accepts the modularization plan.
- Do not split a file only for line count; split when a stable responsibility boundary is clear.
